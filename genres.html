				<ul>
					<li>Centered around musical scales and using them in ways that were unique and different from traditional Western harmony.
					<ul>
						<li>Western harmony relies upon a tonal key center with related chords and cadences; it changes chords frequently.</li>
						<li>Modal harmony, however, will shift modes/scales; it will use a scale longer and then change to a different one. Basically, you go through all the scales in one chord rather then shifting quickly through chords like in Traditional Western music.</li>
					</ul></li>
					<li>Also had great emphasis on improvisation, as artists had more time on chords to create interesting sounds as a result of more time going through all the scales/modes in a chord.</li>
					<li>Instruments like the ones seen before: please see Swing and Big Band for the instruments if further expanation needed.</li>
					<li>Notable artists: George Russell and Miles Davis.</li>
				</ul>

					<li>Along with the instruments common in jazz, use of electric guitar/bass or electric organ/piano became more commonplace.</li>
