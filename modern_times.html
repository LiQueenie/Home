		<h1>Where is Jazz today?</h1>
		<h3> Summary </h3>
		<p>
			The idea of modern is constantly changing, considering if a person from the 1920s was deciding what was 'modern jazz', they would pick swing, 
			even though for us, that is far from modern. As time goes by, innovation will always prevail; in the past, present, and future.
			The development of different subgenres and the fine-tuning of old techniques will always continue. Therefore, starting from the end of the Jazz Era, let's see what 'modern jazz' was. <br>
			<br>
			Whenever a genre is popular, it is natural that subgenres appear after it, and Jazz was no exception 
			from that rule. Coming out of and during the Jazz Era, jazz now had multiple subgenres such as Cool Jazz, Bebop, Modal, are more. 
			If interested, check out the <a href="genres.html">Genres of Jazz</a> page. However, even though there were more genres then ever as a result of globalization, Jazz's popularity started to slow down.
			After the Jazz Era, what you once heard on radios everywhere, was slowly being overtaken. Other genres were starting to get more popular, and the one that really finished jazz off was rock-and-roll. 
			The youth of the time loved it, and Jazz slowly fizzled out into what we see today.<br>
			<br>
			While that might sound tragic, Jazz hasn't completely disappeared.  
			Jazz in the modern day is still exists and it continues to emphasize improvisation with each performer creating a unique sound experience with 
			different notes. Even today, New Orleans is a significant hub for Jazzm. Futhermoer, with the diversity of our current 
			music genres, jazz has been influenced and transformed by various genres like rock, R&B, hip-hop, and pop. 
			Hip-hop, in particular, incorporates Jazz rhythms and harmonies while adding its elements. Furthermore, 
			improvisation is a celebrated skill in both Jazz and hip-hop, allowing artists to express their thoughts 
			and emotions spontaneously. Jazz's ability to transcend language and cultural barriers unites people from 
			diverse backgrounds, and it continues to evolve and shape the future of music.
