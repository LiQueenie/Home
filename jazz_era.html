		<h1>Jazz Era</h1>
		<h3> Summary </h3>
		<p>
			The Jazz Era was a time of happiness and innovation; when jazz finally made it big on the worldwide stage, and it all started with prohibition. 
			As noted earlier(see <a href="early_years.html">Early Years</a>), prohibition-contrary to the belief of state senators-
			just made people want booze a whole lot more. This led to a significant increase in illegal 
			alcohol trade and organized crime activities during its 13-year period. To cope with the change 
			of no alcohol, many secret clubs were created as a way to get that good old booze. However, that secret was not very secret as
			everyone knew about them. Known as speakeasies, these establishments promised alcohol and a good time, 
			at least until the police raided. The centre stage of this facility was none other than jazz, as the upbeat
			and indulgent tune suited the place like a hand in a glove. There started the Roaring Twenties, also known as the Jazz Era. <br>
			<br>
			In the Jazz Era, jazz came into its own, it was a vibrant style, suited for rhythmic dance music, and promoted innovation
			through its emphasis on improvisation. As countryside people started to pour into the cities from the economic growth of 
			the country, for the young men and women—the latter gaining the right to vote in 1920— jazz became their quick favourite. They sought 
			to express their freedom and rebel against social norms, and jazz became the soundtrack to a revolution. Bolstered even 
			further by the creation of the radio, Jazz forever cemented itself into this era.

				<td>Armstrong is widely regarded as one of the most influential musicians in jazz history. With his expertise on the cornet 
				and trumpet with his inventive playing style, he earned his place in the Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame. Armstrong's most
				significant contribution was in his pioneering of solo performances, where he shifted away from collective improvisation, and made others realize they could do the same. He excelled 
				not only in instrumental improvisation but also in vocal improvisation, showcasing his impressive scat singing skills. He has iconic 
				tracks like <i>Savoy Blues</i>, which demonstrated his remarkable guitar improvisation, and also <i>Heebie Jeebies</i>, which showed his legendary vocal improvisation.</td>

				<td>Duke Ellington was an influential composer of the Swing Era; best known for his amazing piano skills. However, his true passion 
				lied in his band, as he viewed each of his members as a unique source of emotional expression. This allowed him to masterfully combine their attributes to 
				create remarkable music. In his composition <i>One O'Clock Jump</i>, the band members showcased their instrumental virtuosity through brief solos
				that exemplified the "Ellington Effect" and highlighted the impact of collaborative interplay and individual artistry within his 
				ensemble.</td>
