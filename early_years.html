		<h1>Jazz in the Beginnings</h1><!--header-->
		<h3> Summary </h3>
		<p><!--Content-->
			As you know, jazz originated in New Orleans, but going further, it all started in West Africa. 
			In the 16th Century, many West Africans were sold as slaves by the Portuguese. With little choice, 
			West Africans were sent across the Atlantic to the American South to work at the farms of wealthy 
			plantation owners, and with them on the ships, was their culture and music. West African music is 
			a simple call and response with single-line melodies, reflecting the speech patterns of their native 
			tongue. However, because they were slaves, many of the forebearers could not purchase instruments, 
			unlike other citizens. Nevertheless, that didnâ€™t stop them; instead, they used whatever they could find. 
			As the music developed, other influences were brought in, such as from the slaves in the Caribbean and 
			the rhythms from church masses.<br>
			<br>
			After the Civil War in America, many of the slaves were free. After emancipation in 1865, a lucky few were 
			able to purchase instruments and learn to play European musical instruments, and they began to create what 
			we all know as jazz.  They played in bars and clubs and began to develop this genre from the ground up. Many 
			forebearers started their ascent to stardom here. Pioneers like Ernest Hogan, who was one of the first African 
			Americans to popular the first jazz genre, ragtime. However, it was in the 20th century when jazz began to gain 
			more popularity. As a result of the world war and growing tensions, prohibition was law throughout America, 
			banning all alcoholic beverages. Naturally, illegalizing something just makes it more desirable, and along with 
			the laws and lawbreakers throughout the era of prohibition through the 1920s to 1930s, came the Jazz Era.<br>

				of the first to popularize the genre, and have pieces still remembered today. All of Scott Joplin's works had a massive effect 
				on jazz as a whole by giving the world a form of music that combines classical techniques with African American melodies and rhythms. Through this,
